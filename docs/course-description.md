# Course Description

## Precision Turf Analytics: Drone-Based Intelligence for Golf Course Management

### Course Title
Precision Turf Analytics: Drone-Based Intelligence for Golf Course Management

### Target Audience
This textbook is designed for golf course superintendents, assistant superintendents, turf management professionals, drone service providers entering the turf analytics vertical, agronomists exploring aerial diagnostic tools, and technology decision-makers evaluating precision turf management platforms. Secondary audiences include turf management students, agricultural extension specialists, and precision agriculture consultants.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of turfgrass management principles (species identification, seasonal growth patterns, common stressors)
- Familiarity with golf course operations and maintenance workflows
- No prior drone experience required — all flight operations are taught from fundamentals
- No programming experience required — AI integration chapters are designed for non-technical operators
- Access to a computer with internet connection for MicroSim interactions

### Course Description
This 16-chapter intelligent textbook provides a comprehensive, practitioner-oriented guide to implementing drone-based precision analytics for golf course turf management. Beginning with the science of multispectral imaging and the unique characteristics of the golf course ecosystem, the course progresses through operational drone flight planning, data capture protocols, image processing workflows, and advanced vegetation index analysis.

Students learn to fly the DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral platform using corridor-based zoning strategies, capture NDVI/NDRE/GNDVI data during optimal time windows, process orthomosaics, and interpret vegetation indices to detect turf stress, disease, irrigation deficits, and chemical over-application — all before symptoms become visible to the human eye.

The business and strategy section covers the competitive platform ecosystem (SGL Golf/TurfBase, GreenSight, SkimTurf, John Deere, POGO Turf Pro), drone services business development including FAA Part 107 certification and pricing models, AI integration for predictive analytics, and the emerging trajectory toward autonomous turf management enabled by BVLOS regulations and robotic systems.
