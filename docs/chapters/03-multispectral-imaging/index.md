## Summary

The human eye perceives only a narrow slice of the electromagnetic spectrum — roughly 400-700 nanometers. Within this visible range, a stressed putting green can look perfectly healthy for days or even weeks before symptoms become apparent. Multispectral sensors extend our perception into the near-infrared (700-1000nm), where the earliest indicators of plant stress, disease onset, and nutrient deficiency are detectable through changes in light reflectance patterns.

Vegetation indices are mathematical combinations of spectral bands that isolate specific plant health indicators. NDVI, the most widely recognized index, compares red and NIR reflectance to quantify photosynthetic activity and biomass density. However, NDVI saturates in dense, healthy turf canopies — exactly the conditions found on well-maintained greens. This is where NDRE becomes essential: by substituting the red edge band (~730nm) for the red band, NDRE detects subtle chlorophyll concentration changes in dense vegetation that NDVI misses entirely. GNDVI provides additional sensitivity to chlorophyll variation across fairways and roughs where canopy density is more variable.

Understanding these indices is not merely academic — it directly determines what a superintendent can and cannot detect from aerial imagery. A drone operator who captures only RGB imagery is essentially taking expensive photographs. One who captures calibrated multispectral data across five bands and understands which index to apply for which question transforms aerial data into actionable agronomic intelligence. This chapter builds the spectral literacy required to make that transformation.
