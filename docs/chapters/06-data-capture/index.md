# Chapter 6: Data Capture Best Practices

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
    - **Identify the optimal capture window** (9:30am-11:30am) and explain why timing matters for spectral consistency
    - **Evaluate environmental conditions** including dew, cloud cover, and shadow patterns before committing to a flight
    - **Apply the "consistency over perfection" principle** to build reliable temporal datasets
    - **Execute a complete on-site capture session** within the 75-90 minute target window

## Key Concepts

1. Optimal capture window (9:30am-11:30am)
2. Dew evaporation timing and impact on reflectance
3. Solar angle and shadow interference
4. Mixed sun/shade avoidance strategies
5. Cloud cover effects on spectral data
6. Consistency over perfection philosophy
7. 75-90 minute on-site time target
8. Calibration panel capture (pre-flight and post-flight)
9. Environmental condition logging
10. Seasonal timing adjustments
11. Wind speed monitoring during capture
12. Superintendent coordination and scheduling
13. Player traffic and safety management
14. Data quality field verification
15. Capture session documentation and metadata

## Summary

The most expensive drone and the most sophisticated sensor array will produce unreliable data if capture conditions are not controlled. Multispectral imaging is fundamentally a measurement of reflected light, and any inconsistency in illumination conditions — dew on leaf surfaces scattering light, cloud shadows creating false stress signatures, low solar angles producing long shadows across greens — introduces noise that degrades or invalidates analytical results. The 9:30am-11:30am capture window exists because it represents the intersection of adequate solar elevation, evaporated dew, and minimal shadow interference.

The single most important principle in data capture is consistency over perfection. A slightly suboptimal dataset captured under the same conditions as last week's dataset enables valid temporal comparison. A "perfect" dataset captured under conditions that differ from the historical baseline breaks the comparison chain. This means establishing and adhering to standard operating procedures: same time of day, same calibration workflow, same altitude and overlap settings, documented environmental conditions. When conditions fall outside acceptable parameters, the professional decision is to reschedule rather than capture compromised data.

A well-executed on-site session follows a predictable rhythm: arrive, assess conditions, deploy calibration panel, capture pre-flight reference, execute mission segments, capture post-flight reference, verify data quality on-device, and document conditions. The 75-90 minute on-site target is achievable with practice and proper preparation, making weekly monitoring sustainable as a service offering. This chapter establishes the field protocols that transform hardware capability into reliable, analyzable data.
