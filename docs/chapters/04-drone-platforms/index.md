15. Total cost of ownership analysis

## Summary

The drone platform is the foundation of any aerial turf analytics operation, and the sensor package it carries determines the ceiling of analytical capability. The DJI Mavic 3 Multispectral has emerged as the dominant platform for turf analytics due to its combination of a high-resolution 20MP RGB camera and four dedicated 5MP multispectral sensors (Green, Red, Red Edge, NIR) in a compact, portable airframe. With a 43-minute maximum flight time and integrated RTK capability, it covers the practical needs of most golf course survey operations within a single battery cycle for 2-3 hole clusters.

RTK positioning transforms raw imagery from "approximately here" to "precisely here" — enabling centimeter-level accuracy that makes temporal comparisons meaningful. Without precise georeferencing, comparing NDVI maps from week to week becomes an exercise in approximation rather than measurement. The M3M's integrated RTK module, paired with a DJI D-RTK 2 base station or NTRIP network connection, eliminates the need for manual ground control point placement that would otherwise add 30-60 minutes to each mission.

While the M3M represents the current sweet spot for turf analytics, understanding the broader platform landscape is essential for operators scaling their services. Enterprise platforms like the DJI Matrice 350 RTK offer heavier payload capacity for specialized sensors including thermal cameras and LIDAR, while fixed-wing platforms like the senseFly eBee provide efficiency advantages for large-acreage surveys. This chapter provides the framework for matching platform capabilities to operational requirements and budget constraints.
