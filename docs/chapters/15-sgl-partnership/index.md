## Summary

SGL's TurfBase platform represents the most mature end-to-end turf analytics platform available, and their Drone Service Provider framework creates a structured pathway for drone operators to enter the turf analytics market with platform support rather than building proprietary technology from scratch. The DSP model addresses a fundamental chicken-and-egg problem: superintendents want proven analytics platforms backed by agronomic expertise, while independent drone operators have flight capability but lack the software infrastructure and turf science credibility to sell enterprise analytics services alone.

The partnership model works through a defined integration: DSPs capture multispectral data following SGL's standardized protocols, upload imagery to TurfBase's cloud processing pipeline, and deliver TurfBase-branded (or white-labeled) analytics reports to their golf course clients. SGL provides the processing infrastructure, vegetation index algorithms, historical trending engine, and superintendent-facing dashboard. The DSP provides local presence, relationship management, flight operations, and ground-truth verification. Revenue flows through commission structures that typically provide the DSP with the majority of per-flight and subscription revenue while SGL captures platform licensing fees.

The demo flight is the critical conversion mechanism in this model. A DSP conducts a complimentary or reduced-cost survey of 3-6 holes, processes the data through TurfBase, and presents results in a 30-minute walkthrough with the superintendent. When the demo reveals stress patterns, irrigation inconsistencies, or early disease indicators that the superintendent was not previously aware of, the conversion to a paid monitoring subscription becomes a natural next step. This chapter details the complete workflow from initial superintendent outreach through demo execution, proposal delivery, contract signing, and ongoing service delivery within the SGL ecosystem.
