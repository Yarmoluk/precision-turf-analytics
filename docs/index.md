# Precision Turf Analytics

## Drone-Based Intelligence for Golf Course Management

**By Chris Duchscher & Daniel Yarmoluk**

---

Golf course management is entering a new era. Multispectral drone imaging, AI-powered analytics, and precision application technologies are transforming how superintendents manage turf health — replacing intuition with data, reducing chemical inputs by 25-30%, and catching disease before it spreads.

This textbook is the definitive guide to drone-based precision turf analytics, written by practitioners who fly the missions and build the intelligence systems.
