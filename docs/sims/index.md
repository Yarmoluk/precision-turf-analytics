# MicroSims

Interactive simulations for hands-on learning.

*MicroSims will be added after chapter content is generated. Planned simulations:*

- **Flight Planning Calculator** — Configure altitude, overlap, speed and see coverage area + flight time
- **NDVI Visualizer** — Upload or simulate multispectral data and visualize vegetation indices
- **ROI Estimator** — Calculate cost savings from precision turf analytics vs traditional methods
- **Spectral Band Explorer** — Interact with different spectral bands and see what each reveals
- **Disease Progression Simulator** — Model turf disease spread and intervention timing
